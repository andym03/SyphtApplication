Completed under the assumption the difference between "04/07/1984 - 25/12/1984" is 173, 
non inclusive of the start and end dates.

Running the program with 0 arguments enters input mode, whereby dates in the format "DD/MM/YYYY - DD/MM/YYYY" can be entered
endlessly. 
Running the program with a text file path will cause the program to read that text file, expecting dates in the aformentioned format,
seperated by new lines.
